# XYZ Payroll http://xyzpayroll.azurewebsites.net/Employee (no longer live :)

XYZ Payroll is a simple asp.net 5 demo web application that calculates employee benefits payroll deductions according to the following simple rules:

    - The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee
    - Each dependent, children and possibly a spouse, is additional deduction of $500/year
    - Anyone whose name startis with 'A' gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent

Other assumptions for simplicity:

    - All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions
    - There are 26 paychecks in a year

# Summing it up
 
That's how it's done, Holmes! A dozen of asp.net mvc SPA views in a few days of work by a pro.

So don't you tell me I got no public asp.net mvc or C# app codes to show. You want tests? I can gen. that too, 
but there is only so much time I am willing to put into yet another silly jump throough hoops code challenge 
and this dumb dumb vinalla app coded over a weekend.
 
This is kindergarten apps for me, smalls! :) Moving on!
