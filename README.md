# ZYZ Payroll

XYZ Payroll is a simple asp.net 5 demo web application that calculates employee benefits payroll deductions according to the following simple rules:

    - The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee
    - Each dependent, children and possibly spouse, is additional deduction of $500/year
    - Anyone whose name startis with 'A' gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent

Other assumptions for simplicity:

    - All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions
    - There are 26 paychecks in a year
