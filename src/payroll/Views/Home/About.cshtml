			XYZ Payroll is a simple asp.net 5 demo web application that calculates employee benefits payroll deductions
			according to the following simple rules:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee</li>
			<li>Each dependent, children and possibly a spouse, is additional deduction of $500/year</li>
			<li>Anyone whose first name startis with 'A' gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Other assumptions for simplicity:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions</li>
			<li>There are 26 paychecks in a year</li>
		</ul>
